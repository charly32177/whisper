\section{Introduction to the Belle Experiment}
The Belle experiment is designed to study the physics of CP violation,
which holds the key to the origin of universe. It is conducted by the Belle collaboration,
an international collaboration of physicists and engineers from 16 countries,
located at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization(KEK) in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture,Japan.
This big project includes two major facilities: the KEKB accelerator and the Belle detector. Figure 2.1 shows
the bird's eye view of the organization.
