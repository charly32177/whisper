abstract = {We present a set of rotationally invariant observables which characterizes the "shapes" of events, and is calculable in quantum-chromodynamics perturbation theory for final states consisting of quarks and gluons (G). We include the effects of fragmentation to hadrons in comparing the shapes of events from the processes e+e-qq», e+e-qq»G, and e+e-heavy resonance GGG, and from heavy-quark and lepton production. We indicate how our analysis may be extended to deep-elastic lepton-hadron interactions and hadron-hadron collisions involving large transverse momenta. {\textcopyright} 1978 The American Physical Society.},

@article{ref:Punzi2003,
abstract = {A frequentist definition of sensitivity of a search for new phenomena is discussed, that has several useful properties. It is based on completely standard concepts, is generally applicable, and has a very clear interpretation. It is particularly suitable for optimization, being independent of a-priori expectations about the presence of a signal, thus allowing the determination of a single set of cuts that is optimal both for setting limits and for making a discovery. Simple approximate formulas are given for the common problem of Poisson counts with background.},

@article{ref:Feindt2011,
abstract = {We describe a new B-meson full reconstruction algorithm designed for the Belle experiment at the B-factory KEKB, an asymmetric e+e- collider that collected a data sample of 771.6×106 BB pairs during its running time. To maximize the number of reconstructed B decay channels, it utilizes a hierarchical reconstruction procedure and probabilistic calculus instead of classical selection cuts. The multivariate analysis package NeuroBayes was used extensively to hold the balance between highest possible efficiency, robustness and acceptable consumption of CPU time. In total, 1104 exclusive decay channels were reconstructed, employing 71 neural networks altogether. Overall, we correctly reconstruct one B± or B 0 candidate in 0.28% or 0.18% of the BB events, respectively. Compared to the cut-based classical reconstruction algorithm used at the Belle experiment, this is an improvement in efficiency by roughly a factor of 2, depending on the analysis considered. The new framework also features the ability to choose the desired purity or efficiency of the fully reconstructed sample freely. If the same purity as for the classical full reconstruction code is desired (∼25%), the efficiency is still larger by nearly a factor of 2. If, on the other hand, the efficiency is chosen at a similar level as the classical full reconstruction, the purity rises from ∼25% to nearly 90%. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.
